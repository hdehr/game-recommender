# Neural Collaborative Filtering for Game Recommendations

This project demonstrates an application of the neural collaborative filtering method from [https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05031](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05031) towards recommending video games from the Steam store. 
To use the Jupyter notebook, first download the dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonkozyriev/game-recommendations-on-steam](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonkozyriev/game-recommendations-on-steam)
and place it in the folder `data/original/`.
